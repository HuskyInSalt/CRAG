#Scientists look to stem cells to mend broken hearts: Cardiac medicine has traditionally been associated with innovative procedures that sometimes where considered heretical to the present day dogma.  For example, the first heart transplant, the use of the balloon catheter, the introduction of thrombolytics, all met substantial resistance from the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù in their time.  It appears that the next revolution in cardiac medicine is the use of stem cells.  Aside from the obvious ethical and moral dilemmas surrounding embryonic tissues, the major controversy has been the belief that heart tissue does not repair itself after it has been lost.  However, slowly but surely it appears that support behind the use of stem cells for heart conditions is gaining momentum.; Scientists look to stem cells to mend broken hearts: One sign of this is the recent announcement that Britain‚Äôs leading heart charity, the British Heart Foundation (BHF), launched a 50 million pound ($80 million) research project into the potential of stem cells to regenerate heart tissue and ‚Äúmend broken hearts‚Äù.; Scientists look to stem cells to mend broken hearts: ‚ÄúScientifically, mending human hearts is an achievable goal and we really could make recovering from a heart attack as simple as getting over a broken leg,‚Äù said Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the BHF.; Scientists look to stem cells to mend broken hearts: One example of research in this area being performed in England is the work of Professor Paul Riley of the Institute of Child Health at University College London (UCL) who has identified a natural protein, called thymosin beta 4, that plays a role in developing heart tissue.  He said his researchers had already had some success in using this protein to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù cells known as epicardial cells in mice with damaged hearts. ‚ÄúWe hope to find similar molecules or drug-like compounds that might be able to stimulate these cells further,‚Äù he told reporters at the briefing.; Scientists look to stem cells to mend broken hearts: Currently the most advanced type of stem cell therapy for the heart involves administration of the patient‚Äôs own bone marrow cells into the area of heart damage after a heart attack.  This work, which was performed in England and internationally, seems to suggest that cardiac muscle may be preserved when cells from the bone marrow produce various growth factors that stimulate stem cells that are already existing in the heart.

The billion-dollar project "MenStar" will target men living with or at risk of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, which has been ravaged by AIDS since the 1980s. Related Articles  Manchester attacker's younger brother arrested in Tripoli - spokesman | ReutersUK police arrest fifth person in connection with Manchester attack | Reuters"The MenStar coalition is bravely tackling the root cause of this problem ‚Äî the lack of awareness of HIV prevention amongst hard-to-reach young men,‚Äù Harry said at the 22nd International AIDS Conference in Amsterdam. Speaking at the launch, which also featured South African actress Charlize Theron and Ndaba Mandela, the grandson of late President Nelson Mandela, Elton John said: "If we want to end AIDS once and for all, we must make men part of the solution." Around 36.7 million people around the world have HIV, according to 2016 figures cited by the United Nations' HIV/AIDS body UNAIDS. Fewer than half of men living with HIV receive treatment compared with 60 percent of women, it said. "It is time there was a global coalition to teach men to protect themselves.

UNAIDS said this month that the fight against HIV/AIDS was "slipping off track" and while deaths were falling and treatment rates rising, rates of new HIV infections threatened to derail efforts to defeat the disease.

"MenStar" is supported by the U.S. government‚Äôs PEPSTAR programme and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

#Suzanne Somers Is a Dangerous Medical Hack: Dog is to horse as Churchill is to Lenin‚Äîoh, whatever. Left uncorrected, though, was the mountain of misinformation and half-truths on which Ms. Somers has built her post-show-business career as a health guru. Since 2004, with the publication of The Sexy Years, she has been a relentless advocate of so-called ‚Äúbioidentical‚Äù hormone replacement therapy for post-menopausal women. In her latest book, I‚Äôm Too Young For This!, published last month by Crown Books, she doubles down, pushing hormone therapy for women in their 40s and even 30s, who have not even undergone menopause yet.; Suzanne Somers Is a Dangerous Medical Hack: Her message can be boiled down to this: Hormone replacement therapy makes life awesome! She's having¬†Sex Twice A Day! Thanks to hormones, her skin is smooth, her hot flashes are gone, and as she claimed in 2006's Ageless, "I have substantially reversed the aging process in my body." She has riffed on this same basic theme in most of her 24 (!) books, from Ageless to Breakthrough to Bombshell to her current offering. And while some of her advice is basic Grandma stuff (eat fresh vegetables, get some exercise, sleep well and manage your stress), it all appears to hinge on these ‚Äúbioidenticals,‚Äù which Somers swears by. In her notorious 2009 Oprah interview, she revealed that she injects hormones directly into her vagina. Every day. Plus a daily shot of human growth hormone.; Suzanne Somers Is a Dangerous Medical Hack: What bioidentical means, technically, is that the hormone molecules are chemically the same as those found in the human body. As used by Somers and her adherents, though, it also means that those hormones (not only estrogen, but progesterone and others) are prepared in a special mixture by a ‚Äúcompounding‚Äù pharmacy, which makes custom preparations of drugs and supplements, to a physician's prescription. Compounding pharmacies are basically unregulated, and hormones are technically considered dietary supplements, and are minimally controlled by the FDA. ‚ÄúBioidenticals are a natural substance and cannot be patented,‚Äù she writes in Ageless. ‚ÄúTherefore, there is no money to be made from selling the best solution for menopausal women.‚Äù; Suzanne Somers Is a Dangerous Medical Hack: FDA approved means it‚Äôs been tested for safety, efficacy, and dosing and absorption; the drug companies have researched, and patented, the various delivery methods (pills, creams, skin patches, even a nasal spray.) And doctors know how much of the hormone their patients are really getting. With compounding, not so much. Last year, contamination at a compounding pharmacy in Framingham, Mass. caused an outbreak of fungal meningitis that killed 48 people and sickened more than 700. An FDA study of compounded drugs found that the actual dosage varied by as much as 280 percent.; Suzanne Somers Is a Dangerous Medical Hack: Many experts object to the aggressive way in which Somers advocates using the hormones, cranking her estrogen (and testosterone!) levels up to those of a 30-year-old in her sexual prime. After Ageless came out in 2006, seven prominent OB-Gyns wrote her an open letter‚Äîincluding three of the doctors she had actually quoted in the book‚Äîcriticizing her for pushing the ‚ÄúWiley Protocol,‚Äù an intensive hormone regimen invented by a writer and actress whose medical credentials consisted of a bachelor‚Äôs degree in anthropology. ‚ÄúIs it healthy to be dosed like a 30-year-old when you‚Äôre 60?‚Äù asks¬†Dr. Joann Pinkerton, Director of the Midlife Health Center at the University of Virginia Health System. ‚ÄúShow me the evidence.‚Äù

While these drugs are effective in treating serious bacterial infections, an FDA safety review found that both oral and injectable fluroquinolones are associated with disabling side effects involving tendons, muscles, joints, nerves and the central nervous system. These side effects can occur hours to weeks after exposure to fluoroquinolones and may potentially be permanent.; U.S. Food and Drug Administration: Because the risk of these serious side effects generally outweighs the benefits for patients with acute bacterial sinusitis, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and uncomplicated urinary tract infections, the FDA has determined that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for use in patients with these conditions who have no alternative treatment options. For some serious bacterial infections, including anthrax, plague and bacterial pneumonia among others, the benefits of fluoroquinolones outweigh the risks and it is appropriate for them to remain available as a therapeutic option.; U.S. Food and Drug Administration: FDA-approved fluoroquinolones include levofloxacin (Levaquin), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, moxifloxacin (Avelox), ofloxacin and gemifloxacin (Factive). The labeling changes include an updated Boxed Warning and revisions to the Warnings and Precautions section of the label about the risk of disabling and potentially irreversible adverse reactions that can occur together. The label also contains new limitation-of-use statements to reserve fluoroquinolones for patients who do not have other available treatment options for acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and uncomplicated urinary tract infections. The patient Medication Guide that is required to be given to the patient with each fluoroquinolone prescription describes the safety issues associated with these medicines.

#Does Most Domestic Violence Occur on Super Bowl Sunday?: About this rating   ; Does Most Domestic Violence Occur on Super Bowl Sunday?: Thursday, January 28 A news conference was called in Pasadena, California, the site of the forthcoming Super Bowl game, by a coalition of women's groups. At the news conference reporters were informed that significant anecdotal evidence suggested that Super Bowl Sunday is "the biggest day of the year for violence against women." Prior to the conference, there had been reports of increases as high as 40 percent in calls for help from victims that day. At the conference, Sheila Kuehl of the California Women's Law Center cited a study done at Virginia's Old Dominion University three years before, saying that it found police reports of beatings and hospital admissions in northern Virginia rose 40 percent after games won by the Redskins during the 1988-89 season. The presence of Linda Mitchell at the conference, a representative of a media "watchdog" group called Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), lent credibility to the cause.At about this time a very large media mailing was sent by Dobisky Associates, warning at-risk women, "Don't remain at home with him during the game." The idea that sports fans are prone to attack wives or girlfriends on that climactic day persuaded many men as well: Robert Lipsyte of the New York Times would soon be referring to the "Abuse Bowl."; Does Most Domestic Violence Occur on Super Bowl Sunday?: Friday, January 29 Lenore Walker, a Denver psychologist and author of The Battered Woman, appeared on "Good Morning America" claiming to have compiled a ten-year record showing a sharp increase in violent incidents against women on Super Bowl Sundays.

Gorov cited "one study of women's shelters out West" that "showed a 40 percent climb in calls, a pattern advocates said is repeated nationwide, including in Massachusetts."; Does Most Domestic Violence Occur on Super Bowl Sunday?: Commentators were quick to offers reasons why this "fact" was so obviously true: Men are mostly loutish brutes, and football is the epitome of mindless, aggressive, violent, testosterone-driven macho posturing, so certainly during the culmination of the football season and its final, spectacular, massively-hyped "super" game, more men than ever were going to express their excitement or disappointment by smacking their wives and girlfriends around. So much attention did the "Super Bowl abuse" stories garner that NBC aired a public service announcement before the 1993 game to remind men that domestic violence is a crime.

Vasectomy includes three steps: anesthesia, delivery and isolation of the vas deferens from the scrotal sac, and vas occlusion.; Bookshelf: Among the surgical procedures, vasectomy, in addition to being more effective and safer, costs less than tubal ligation by either laparoscopy or laparotomy (Smith, Taylor, and Smith 1985).

#      Testosterone therapy may be safe for men at risk for heart attack and stroke  : For an average of 22 months, the men applied a gel to their skin daily. For half of the men, the gel was a placebo (inactive). For the others, it contained enough testosterone to maintain their hormone levels between 350 and 750 ng/dL. At the three-year follow-up, the researchers found no difference in the rate of heart attacks, strokes, or death from cardiovascular problems between the TRT and placebo groups. However, compared with the men using the placebo, those using TRT were more likely to have developed atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rate that can increase the risk for stroke and heart failure) and pulmonary embolism (in which a blood clot travels to a lung artery and blocks blood flow).

#GUN-RIGHTS GROUP SAYS HEALTH CARE BILL COULD HARM GUN OWNERS: But we find insufficient evidence to support the group's overheated rhetoric.

There is nothing in the bill itself to indicate that is contemplated. We find the statement False.

#Our History: In 1916, the idea of Planned Parenthood began at the first birth control clinic, in Brownsville, Brooklyn. Today, there are nearly 600 Planned Parenthood health centers around the country, operated by 49 local affiliates.¬†; Our History: In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of abortion rights in the landmark case Roe v. Wade, citing the right to privacy. Roe v. Wade guaranteed the right to safe and legal abortion within the first three months of pregnancy in all 50 states.¬†; Our History: However, in 1976, the Hyde Amendment made it illegal for people who get their health insurance through Medicaid to use their insurance to cover abortion, except in a few circumstances, such as cases of rape, incest, or a life-endangering pregnancy. So even while abortion was legal, it was becoming out of reach for people with low incomes in need of financial assistance, or for those who receive health care through Medicaid or Medicare.; Our History: But throughout these difficult times, Planned Parenthood remained steadfast in its commitment to patients and its vision of a world without barriers to sexual and reproductive health care.¬†¬†; Our History: In 1996, Planned Parenthood launched www.plannedparenthood.org, which made expert reproductive and sexual health information easily accessible for everyone.

But the classic gospel song ‚ÄúPrecious Lord Take My Hand‚Äù             was actually written by a different man with the same name.; The classic gospel song "Precious Lord" was written by band leader Tommy Dorsey-Fiction!:              The actual story of the tragic death of his wife is a bit different             from the eRumor.             In an account in his own words written for Guideposts Magazine,             Dorsey said he was actually scheduled to be in St. Louis to sing for             a revival.             He had anxiety about going because his wife was in her 9th month of             pregnancy             When he left his home to head for St. Louis, he realized that he had             forgotten his music case, so he returned to get it and found his             wife sleeping.             He stood next to her and felt that something was telling him to stay             home.              He decided to leave and headed back to his car for the drive to the             meetings.             The next night at the revival and after he had finished singing, a             telegram was handed to him that said his wife had just died.             He returned home to learn that his wife had given birth to a baby             boy before she died.             Before the night was over, the baby had died as well.             Dorsey went through a difficult period after that.             He said he wanted to give up serving the Lord and go back to jazz.             One of the thoughts that haunted him was whether his reluctance to             leave his pregnant wife had been a leading from God and whether he             had been disobedient by ignoring it.             He vowed that he would never be insensitive to such a leading again.             It was during a subsequent visit to a friend that he sat down at a             piano and found himself at peace and a melody being played.             That became the song ‚ÄúPrecious Lord Take My Hand.‚Äù             Dorsey wrote, ‚ÄúAs the Lord gave me             these words and melody, He also healed my spirit. I learned that             when we are in our deepest grief, when we feel farthest from God,             this is when He is closest, and when we are most open to His             restoring power. And so I go on living for God willingly and             joyfully, until that day comes when He will take me and gently lead             me home.‚Äù

The patient, who is suffering from alcoholism and liver and kidney failure, as well as moderate dementia, told her he was the grandson of the famous French post-impressionist artist, Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec.

#McDonald's new menu item: Calorie counts: The decision to post calorie information in the U.S. follows the Supreme Court's decision this summer to uphold President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, which includes a regulation that would require restaurant chains with more than 20 locations to post calorie information. The timetable for carrying out that requirement is being worked out."More and more, customers are inquiring about lifestyle decisions, and so, this makes it easy for them," said Jim Tingen, the director of operations for several McDonald's restaurants in Harnett County.Tingen said the added information doesn't seem to suppress anyone's appetite for a Big Mac or large fries."McDonald's is a treat. It isn't designed to do every day for every meal," he said.Customer Chance Kuzma bears that out, saying having the calorie count up in lights won't bag his eating habits."I'm on a 'see food' diet. I see it, I eat it," Kuzma said, adding that he still appreciates the calorie information."Being a power-lifting guy, I like to look at my diet. It's nice to see what I'm eating instead of taking everything blindly on the run," he said.Customer Crystal Hernandez said she didn't notice the calorie information when she ordered her lunch Friday but said it wouldn't change her decision."I come in here to get what I get, eat and go," Hernandez said.Corporate Accountability International, which has urged McDonald's to stop marketing its food to children, notes that the chain has fought efforts to institute menu labeling in local jurisdictions in the past and said its latest move was "certainly not voluntary."The posting of calorie information isn't a magic bullet in fighting obesity but could have a big effect over time, says Margo Wootan, director of nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which advocates on nutrition and food safety issues."Obesity isn't the kind of thing where one day you wake up and you're fat. We gradually and slowly gain weight over time," she said.So even if only some people are swayed to make slightly better choices, Wootan thinks there's a big benefit to providing calorie information.Another upside is that companies tend to work harder to provide healthier options when they're forced to display calorie information."It can be embarrassing, or shocking, so they end up changing the way the product is made," Wootan said.Joe Finn, a sales manager from Oconomowoc, Wis., said he was surprised at the calorie information posted at a hamburger restaurant when he flew out to California earlier this year for the Rose Bowl."All the calories were up there, and I thought, 'Well, I'm not going to order that,'" said Finn, 51, who's trying to watch what he eats. He ended up picking the most basic burger, without cheese.Back at home, he tries to stick to options where he knows the calorie information, such as Subway sandwiches."Otherwise, you could be ordering a gut bomb," he said.The move by McDonald's could spur other restaurant chains to move ahead of the federal regulation."I'm sure they'll follow suit. They usually do," Tingen said.The Wendy's Co. did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Representatives for Burger King Worldwide Inc. and Yum Brands Inc, which owns Taco Bell and KFC, said they're waiting for further guidance from regulators before updating their menus.McDonald's is also testing healthier options for next year, such as an Egg McMuffin made with egg whites and a whole grain muffin. The sandwich has Canadian bacon and white cheddar cheese and clocks in at 260 calories. It will be called the Egg White Delight.The chain is also testing versions of the McWrap, which is a bigger version of its chicken Snack Wrap that is already sold in Europe.

#Current US Food and Drug Administration-Approved Pharmacologic Therapies for the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Diarrhea: In the phase¬†3 IBS-D retreatment study (TARGET¬†3), all enrollees initially received an open-label course of rifaximin 550¬†mg t.i.d. for 2¬†weeks, allowing for a ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù assessment of therapeutic effectiveness [21]. A total of 1074 of 2438 participants (44.1%) were considered symptom responders (defined as simultaneously achieving at least 30% decrease from baseline in mean weekly abdominal pain score and at least 50% decrease from baseline in the number of days/week with BSFS type¬†6 or 7 stool for at least two of the first 4¬†weeks post-treatment) and were then monitored during an 18-week treatment-free phase for assessment of IBS symptom recurrence (loss of abdominal pain or stool consistency response, using the above criteria, for at least 3¬†weeks in a consecutive, rolling 4-week period) [21]. Patients experiencing symptom recurrence subsequently were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive two 2-week courses of rifaximin (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ328) or placebo (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ308), with each course separated by 10¬†weeks [21]. A significantly larger percentage of patients in the rifaximin group were responders to repeat treatment (primary efficacy endpoint; assessed using the same abdominal pain and stool consistency composite endpoint) versus placebo (38.1% vs. 31.5%, respectively; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.03), and prevention of recurrence and durable response were significantly greater with rifaximin versus placebo [21] (Table¬†1). As observed in the pivotal trials [20], the rifaximin safety profile during the double-blind phase of TARGET¬†3 was generally comparable with that of placebo [21]. The most common AEs in the rifaximin and placebo groups during the 22-week double-blind phase were nausea (3.7% vs. 2.3%, respectively), upper respiratory tract infection (3.7% vs. 2.6%), and urinary tract infection (3.4% vs. 4.9%). A similar percentage of patients receiving rifaximin (1.2%) and placebo (1.3%) experienced serious AEs, none of which were considered by investigators to be treatment-related.; Current US Food and Drug Administration-Approved Pharmacologic Therapies for the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Diarrhea: The most common AEs reported for eluxadoline 75¬†mg, 100¬†mg, and placebo were constipation (7.4% vs. 8.6% vs. 2.5%, respectively), nausea (8.1% vs. 7.5% vs. 5.1%), and abdominal pain (5.8% vs. 7.2% vs. 4.1%); and serious AEs were experienced by 4.2% versus 4.8% versus 3.0% of patients, respectively [25]. Pancreatitis [5/1666 (0.3%)] and sphincter of Oddi spasm [8/1666 (0.5%)] occurred in patients receiving eluxadoline; in nine patients, including all eight individuals experiencing sphincter of Oddi dysfunction spasm, these AEs were associated with the absence of a gallbladder. Another pooled analysis including the two phase¬†3 studies (3001 and 3002) and a phase¬†2 study indicated that AEs leading to study discontinuation occurred in a greater percentage of patients receiving eluxadoline 75¬†mg or 100¬†mg b.i.d. compared with placebo (8.3% of 807 patients and 7.8% of 1032 patients vs. 4.3% of 975 patients, respectively) [28]. In this pooled safety analysis, a total of seven serious AEs of pancreatitis were reported during clinical trials [28]. On the basis of data from the three aforementioned trials (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ3235), eluxadoline had an NNT of 12.5 (95% CI 8‚Äì33) [8], and on the basis of discontinuations due to AEs in the phase¬†3 trials, eluxadoline 75¬†mg b.i.d. had an NNH of 25.2, while eluxadoline 100¬†mg b.i.d. had an NNH of 23.3 [25].

#Iranian Revolution: During his exile, Khomeini coordinated this upsurge of opposition‚Äîfirst from Iraq and after 1978 from France‚Äîdemanding the shah‚Äôs abdication. In January 1979, in what was officially described as a ‚Äúvacation,‚Äù the shah and his family fled Iran. The Regency Council established to run the country during the shah‚Äôs absence proved unable to function, and Prime Minister Shahpur Bakhtiar, hastily appointed by the shah before his departure, was incapable of effecting compromise with either his former National Front colleagues or Khomeini. Crowds in excess of one million demonstrated in TehrƒÅn, proving the wide appeal of Khomeini, who arrived in Iran amid wild rejoicing on February 1. Ten days later, on February 11, Iran‚Äôs armed forces declared their neutrality, effectively ousting the shah‚Äôs regime. Bakhtiar went into hiding, eventually to find exile in France.; Iranian Revolution: Mehdi Bazargan[c] Morteza Motahhari[d] ; Iranian Revolution: Beginning in 1963, Pahlavi implemented a number of reforms aimed at modernizing Iranian society, in what is known as the White Revolution. In light of his continued vocal opposition to the modernization campaign after being arrested twice, Khomeini was exiled from Iran in 1964. However, as major ideological tensions persisted between Pahlavi and Khomeini, anti-government demonstrations began in October 1977, eventually developing into a campaign of civil resistance that included elements of secularism and Islamism.[8][9][10] In August 1978, the deaths of between 377 and 470 people in the Cinema Rex fire ‚Äî claimed by the opposition as having been orchestrated by Pahlavi's SAVAK  ‚Äî came to serve as a catalyst for a popular revolutionary movement across all of Iran,[11][12] and large-scale strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the entire country for the remainder of that year. ; Iranian Revolution: The Shah's regime was seen as an oppressive, brutal,[37][38] corrupt, and lavish regime by some of the society's classes at that time.[37][39] It also suffered from some basic functional failures that brought economic bottlenecks, shortages, and inflation.[40] The Shah was perceived by many as beholden to‚Äîif not a puppet of‚Äîa non-Muslim Western power (i.e., the United States)[41][42] whose culture was affecting that of Iran. At the same time, support for the Shah may have waned among Western politicians and media‚Äîespecially under the administration of U.S. President Jimmy Carter‚Äîas a result of the Shah's support for OPEC petroleum price increases earlier in the decade.[43] When President Carter enacted a human-rights policy which said that countries guilty of human-rights violations would be deprived of American arms or aid, this helped give some Iranians the courage to post open letters and petitions in the hope that the repression by the government might subside.[44] ; Iranian Revolution: In 1941, an invasion of allied British and Soviet troops deposed Reza Shah, who was considered friendly to Nazi Germany, and installed his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as Shah.[59] Iran remained under Soviet occupation until the Red Army withdrew in June 1946.[60]

Markers of pulmonary inflammation (such as surfactant protein D) and of systemic inflammation (such as C-reactive protein (CRP)) are elevated in patients with stable COPD [8, 39‚Äì41], while patients with COPD and CVD have higher blood concentrations of inflammatory markers, such as fibrinogen, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, than those without CVD [8]. Moreover, coronary artery calcification scores (a marker of coronary atherosclerosis) correlate with markers of systemic and pulmonary inflammation, such as IL-6, IL-8, surfactant protein D and peripheral blood neutrophil count, in patients with COPD [42]. These findings suggest that COPD is either a systemic inflammatory state or that inflammatory processes spill over from the lungs into the systemic circulation [43], contributing to the development of CVD.

To reach the conclusion the team used analysed public genome sequence data from SARS-CoV-2 released by China and identified several tell-tale signs suggesting COVID-19 is an organic virus. ; Is COVID-19 Man-Made or Natural?: Since the virus was first reported in Hubei Province in December it has infected over 1.4 million people in more than 200 countries. The WHO has classified COVID-19 as a pandemic, with global governments and healthcare systems rallying to "flatten the curve" and save lives. ; Is COVID-19 Man-Made or Natural?: While there has been speculation that the virus was developed in laboratories and released either accidently or as a form of bioterrorism, findings published in the journal¬†Nature Medicine confirm COVID-19 is a product of natural evolution. The study was titled 'The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2' and highlights strong evidence for natural evolution. ; Is COVID-19 Man-Made or Natural?: They found that the spike protein, a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that hooks onto host cells, had evolved to target ACE2, an enzyme founded on the outer surface of human cells that helps to regulate blood pressure. The team say the COVID-19 spike protein is so efficient at binding to human cells that it could only be a result of natural selection, not artificial engineering. Another tell-tale sign of natural origins is the molecular structure of COVID-19, which is substantially different from other known viruses. Rather than mimicking other viruses known to cause severe illness in humans, COVID-19 more closely resembles strains of coronavirus found in bats and pangolins.

#          : Press release;           : Throughout the course of their terms in office, Governors Walker and Dayton have pursued dramatically divergent agendas. Governor Walker‚Äôs policies have been typical of the most conservative state agendas: large tax cuts for businesses and higher-income households, deregulation, huge cuts in public financing of everything from K‚àí12 and higher education to green energy programs and aid to the poor, weakening labor standards and cutting safety net programs, shifting public funding to the private sector, undermining workers‚Äô ability to form unions, and rejecting federal dollars to invest in infrastructure or expand Medicaid (Stein, Marley, and Bergquist 2011; Stein and Boulton 2013; Umhoefer 2012; Stein 2012; Stein 2013; COWS 2011; Associated Press 2012).

In Walker‚Äôs first term, Wisconsin cut taxes by $2 billion (Wisconsin Budget Project 2011; Stein 2013; Hovorka 2017). Nevertheless, the state did not come anywhere close to meeting Walker‚Äôs professed employment targets. In fact, as Walker nears the end of his second term, the state still has not reached the governor‚Äôs campaign goal.;           : Table 1 shows that Minnesota has had stronger job growth than Wisconsin since both governors took office.

New research suggests consuming broccoli could also slow or reverse blood-vessel damage and atherosclerosis due to high cholesterol. The study found that a high-cholesterol diet combined with supplements containing sulforaphane, a natural compound in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts, significantly reduced levels of LDL, the so-called ‚Äòbad cholesterol‚Äô, in rabbits, compared with a high-fat diet without the supplements. Sulforaphane-fed rabbits also had higher levels of good cholesterol and improved blood-vessel function. Previous studies showed that sulforaphane can reduce inflammation in cultured vascular cells, but its effects on atherosclerosis hadn‚Äôt been studied directly, the researchers said. Sulforaphane has an ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù ability to trigger multiple enzymes that protect against oxidative or environmental stress and reduce inflammation, they suggest. This study, at Mansoura University in Egypt, involved three groups of five rabbits. Two of the groups were fed a high-cholesterol diet for four weeks, including one group that also received daily supplements of sulforaphane orally in a sodium solution. A control group were fed a normal diet without sulforaphane. Results show that treatment with sulforaphane decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL by 43%, 70% and 40%, respectively, compared with untreated rabbits on a high-cholesterol diet. Sulforaphane treatment also enhanced levels of HDL, the so-called ‚Äògood cholesterol‚Äô, above normal. The cholesterol ratio, an indication of heart-disease risk, was close to control levels in sulforaphane-treated animals, the study said. After four weeks, CRP, or C-reactive protein, a marker of systemic inflammation, significantly decreased in suforaphane-treated rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet compared with rabbits on the same diet that didn‚Äôt get the supplement. CRP levels in sulforaphane-treated rabbits were almost at control levels. Blood vessels from rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet were atrophied and inflamed. There was mild vessel swelling in sulforaphane-treated rabbits, while control rabbits had normal vessels. Sulforaphane attenuates the development of atherosclerosis and improves endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.

Policy Responses to COVID-19Policy Responses to COVID-19: At end-March 2020, the Ministry of Finance issued a revised budget for FY20, including Tk. 2.5 billion in additional resources, to fund the Ministry of Health's COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan and expand the existing transfer programs that benefit the poor. Increased allocation was made to the Open Market Sale program to facilitate the purchase of rice at one-third the market price. On March 31, the Ministry of Finance announced a Tk. 50 billion (about US$ 588 million) stimulus package for exporting industries to be channeled through Bangladesh Bank (BB) and distributed by the commercial banks at a 2 percent service charge. This special fund, for worker's salary support, was disbursed through mobile financial services and bank accounts benefitting close to 4 million workers over a four-month period. The Ministry of Finance is also subsidizing interest payments on working capital loans of up to Tk. 600 billion (about US$ 7.1 billion) provided by scheduled banks to businesses. On April 15 2020, the Prime Minister announced the allocation of Tk. 21.3 billion (about US$ 250.9 million) under a housing scheme for the homeless, Tk.15 billion (about US$ 176.7 million) for the poor who faced job losses from the pandemic, Tk.7.5 billion (about US$ 88.3 million) to provide health insurance for government employees most at risk, and Tk. 1 billion (about US$ 11.8 million) in bonus payments for public health workers treating COVID-19 patients. The Prime Minister has also announced that Tk. 20 billion (about US$ 235.6 million) in interest payments on behalf of 13.8 million loan recipients negatively impacted by the national shutdown will be covered by the government. In January 2021, the government increased the COVID-19 Emergency Response and Pandemic Preparedness Project costs by Tk 56.6 billion (about US$ 666.7 million) mostly reflecting the procurement, preservation, and distribution of vaccines. The government has announced two additional stimulus packages - Tk. 15 billion for the micro credit and marginal people's lifestyle development program, and Tk. 12 billion for the old age and widow allowance expansion program. In the first week of May 2021, the government announced its second-round cash assistance program of Tk. 9.3 billion for the targeted population who lost their jobs from the ongoing lockdown. Thus far, Tk. 390.7 billion (about US$ 4.6 billion) of fiscal stimulus has been announced, of which Tk.186 billion (about US$ 2.2 billion) has been disbursed as of end-April, 2021. In addition, the National Board of Revenue has suspended duties and taxes on imports of medical supplies, including protective equipment and test kits. The FY22 Budget includes higher allocations (in Taka) for health, agriculture, and social safety net programs, although effective targeting remains a challenge. As a precautionary measure, the government has decided that 25 percent of budgetary allocations for development projects will be placed on hold, affecting low-priority projects.

However, as the spread of COVID-19 was much lower than expected, the authorities spent less on COVID-related needs than anticipated. Of the HTG 18.2 billion (1.3 percent of revised GDP) allocated in April for COVID-related spending, actual expenditures amounted to HTG 8.4 Bn (0.6 percent of GDP). Most of this (HTG 5.6 billion) was dedicated to health, while transfers to households, businesses and schools were trimmed to HTG 2.3 billion from HTG 8.3 billion. Nonetheless, the level of spending on health, education, and social protection combined was well above pre-COVID-19 projections‚Äïby 0.6 percent of GDP. The authorities have also committed to report monthly on COVID-related expenditures and undertake an ex post financial and operational audit on COVID spending.: The authorities launched a public health preparedness plan for containment and treatment; they boosted some social programs, and engaged into additional health care and security spending, as well as transfers to support workers and households, including supporting wage payments temporarily in some sectors.

Over the past fifteen years, the U.S. has resettled 51 refugees there, of whom 47 were Somali, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center, which tracks refugee resettlement in the United States. The largest number of refugees to resettle in the town in a single year was 11. With a population of around 20,000, these arrivals represent less than one percent of Shelbyville's total population.; Did Somali Muslims Take Over a Small Tennessee Town?: Official resettlement isn't the only way refugees arrive in U.S. communities, however. In the case of Shelbyville, already-resettled refugees began moving there in the early 2000s in order to take advantage of job openings in the local meatpacking industry. Exact counts are hard to come by, although, according to a 2010 U.S. Census estimate, Shelbyville had 446 foreign-born residents originating from sub-Saharan Africa as of that year, amounting to 2.3 percent of the total population. In a small town, that could cause a noticeable cultural shift. But it's hardly a "takeover."

#                         Jury clears J&J of liability in California talc cancer case                     :  By Tina Bellon (Reuters) - A California jury on Wednesday cleared Johnson & Johnson  of liability in a case involving a woman who alleged that the company's talc-based products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos and caused her cancer, the company said. Related Articles  Manchester attacker's younger brother arrested in Tripoli - spokesman | ReutersUK police arrest fifth person in connection with Manchester attack | ReutersThe jury in Humboldt County Superior Court in Eureka, California rejected claims by Carla Allen who said that her mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, was caused by the company's talc products, including Johnson's Baby Powder. J&J denies the allegations, saying decades of scientific testing and regulatory approvals have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free. Plaintiffs in the litigation allege that J&J knew of asbestos fibres in its cosmetic talc and concealed risks associated with the products. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company faces some 11,700 U.S. talc lawsuits, according to an October regulatory filing. More than 9,700 of those cases involve claims over ovarian cancer, recent filings in New Jersey federal court, where most of the cases are consolidated, showed. The remaining plaintiffs allege asbestos in J&J's talc caused them to develop mesothelioma. J&J in a statement on Wednesday said it was pleased with the jury's decision in the case of Allen. "While we deeply sympathise with anyone suffering from any form of cancer, the science and facts show that her disease was not caused by her use of our talcum-based products," the company said. The California jury reached its decision following a roughly seven-week long jury trial, court records showed, but further details were not immediately available. Lawyers for Allen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. J&J has been fighting talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but the litigation shifted in recent months to include allegations of asbestos contamination. Plaintiffs now claim asbestos fibres in the products are causing both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. J&J to date has been cleared of liability in three mesothelioma cases. It has lost two mesothelioma cases in New Jersey and California, with juries awarding a total of $142 million in damages. Both cases are under appeal. Four additional mesothelioma cases resulted in a mistrial because jurors could not reach a verdict or because the plaintiff died. In July, a Missouri jury hit J&J with a massive $4.69 billion verdict in the first trial alleging asbestos contamination has caused ovarian cancer in 22 women. That decision is also under appeal.

The discovery was a ‚Äúserendipitous finding‚Äù in the lab of Rajan Sah, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Iowa.‚ÄúWhen we exercise and move our muscles, we activate calcium cycling to cause muscle contraction,‚Äù said Sah. ‚ÄúThis same calcium signal also activates signaling pathways to increase skeletal muscle endurance and also skeletal muscle size.‚ÄùSah‚Äôs research team hypothesized that low level calcium cycling induced by these natural compounds might promote improved exercise capacity and overall metabolic health associated with healthy muscle mass.‚ÄúWe tested these compounds in sedentary mice and found a dramatic improvement in exercise endurance and a mild increase in muscle size of certain muscle groups,‚Äù Sah says.The intellectual property associated with this discovery was recently licensed by the UI Research Foundation to Innovus Pharma, an over-the-counter consumer goods and specialty pharmaceutical company that commercializes non-prescription medicine and consumer care products. The company plans to develop the discovery into an over-the-counter (OTC) product to combat cachexia.‚ÄúThe oncology supportive care market is a very large unmet medical market with limited choices to both physicians and patients,‚Äù said Bassam Damaj, chief executive officer of Innovus Pharma. ‚ÄúThe treatment of cachexia just doesn‚Äôt exist. It is a miserable, frequent event that every physician knows about and many patients experience, but there is simply little available against it and nothing to prevent it.‚Äù

Currently, there is no treatment that slows the progression of the disease, which is the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65.; Stem Cell Injection May Soon Reverse Vision Loss Caused By Age-Related Macular Degeneration: "This is the first study to show preservation of vision after a single injection of induced neural progenitor stem cells into a AMD-like rat model for retinal degeneration," said Shaomei Wang, MD, PhD, lead author of the study published in the journal STEM CELLS and a research scientist in the Eye Program at the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute.; Stem Cell Injection May Soon Reverse Vision Loss Caused By Age-Related Macular Degeneration: The stem cell injection resulted in 130 days of preserved vision in laboratory rats, which roughly equates to 16 years in humans.Age-related macular degeneration affects upward of 15 million Americans. It occurs when the small central portion of the retina, known as the macula, deteriorates. The retina is the light-sensing nerve tissue at the back of the eye. Macular degeneration may also be caused by environmental factors, aging and a genetic predisposition.; Stem Cell Injection May Soon Reverse Vision Loss Caused By Age-Related Macular Degeneration: When animal models with macular degeneration were injected with induced neural progenitor stem cells, which derive from the more commonly known induced pluripotent stem cells, healthy cells began to migrate around the retina and formed a protective layer. This protective layer prevented ongoing degeneration of the vital retinal cells responsible for vision.

#A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy: In a long-term study of the latest treatment for peanut allergy, scientists in Australia report that an immune-based therapy helped children allergic to peanuts eat them without reactions for four years.; A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy: The study, published in the journal Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, follows up on children enrolled in an earlier study of an immunotherapy treatment, which combined probiotics with small doses of peanuts that were designed to gradually train the children‚Äôs immune systems to accept the peanut allergen rather than treat it as something foreign. Previous studies have suggested that methods like these could be effective in reducing youngsters‚Äô allergic, sometimes dangerous anaphylactic shock reactions to peanuts. The Australian team added probiotics to further enhance the gut‚Äôs ability to accept the peanuts and not trigger an immune reaction. Compared to 4% of children who didn‚Äôt get any treatment, 82% of those receiving the combination therapy significantly reduced their allergic reactions to peanuts.; A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy: MORE: Babies Should Eat Eggs and Peanuts Early to Avoid Food Allergies; A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy: In the follow-up, which tracked the children for four years after they were treated with the combination therapy, 67% of those who got the combination probiotic and peanut therapy were comfortable eating peanuts, compared to only 4% of those who did not get the treatment. Fewer children in the treated group had an allergic reaction to the peanuts, and they also showed smaller reactions to skin prick tests with peanut allergen.; A New Therapy May Cure Kids of Peanut Allergy: The results are encouraging, allowing the children who were treated to eat peanuts without fear of an allergic reaction. But it may be too early to call this a cure. The researchers believe that adding probiotics to the peanut allergens may be important in improving the children‚Äôs tolerance to the food, but Dr. Anna Nowak-Wegrzyn, an associate professor of pediatrics at Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai Hospital who was not involved in the study, notes that the researchers didn‚Äôt compare the effect of the probiotics themselves; they only compared children who received the probiotics along with immune therapy to those who didn‚Äôt get any treatment at all.

#Reducing Radiation Successfully Treats HPV-Positive Oropharynx Cancers  and Minimizes Side Effects: INFORMATION FOR; Reducing Radiation Successfully Treats HPV-Positive Oropharynx Cancers  and Minimizes Side Effects: Human papillomavirus-positive oropharynx cancers (cancers of the tonsils and back of the throat) are on rise.

#Are Most Cruise Ships Registered Under Foreign Flags?: About this rating   ; Are Most Cruise Ships Registered Under Foreign Flags?: Start with the airlines. Rather than using their profits from the past five years to pay off debts and save for a rainy day, the big four ‚Äî American, United, Delta and Southwest ‚Äî instead grew their combined liabilities to $166 billion, all while spending $39 billion on share repurchases. That number, which is only from the big four, is almost 80% of what they‚Äôre asking for now from U.S. taxpayers.

The top cruise executives managed to haul in $448 million. Now, taxpayers are unwillingly being called upon to bail out their profligate behavior.; Are Most Cruise Ships Registered Under Foreign Flags?: A widely circulated meme on social media offered another reason why cruise lines were supposedly unworthy of government bailouts -- because although they might be headquartered in the U.S., their ships were foreign-flagged in order to put them out of reach of U.S. law:; Are Most Cruise Ships Registered Under Foreign Flags?: That nearly every major cruise line registers their ships somewhere outside the U.S. is hardly a disputable point.

# Criminal Section Selected Case Summaries : In the evening hours of July 12, 2008, six members of the Shenandoah Valley, Pennsylvania, High School football team, approached Luis Ramirez in a park and assaulted him. Derrick Donchak, one of the assailants, beat Mr. Ramirez with a piece of metal called a "fist pack." Colin Walsh punched Mr. Ramirez in the face causing him to fall backwards to the ground, hitting his head. Brandon Piekarsky kicked Mr. Ramirez in the head while he was on the ground. During the beating, the assailants repeatedly yelled racial epithets at Mr. Ramirez and told him to leave Shenandoah and "go back to Mexico." As Mr. Ramirez lay unconscious on the ground, the group ran from the scene. As Piekarsky ran, he yelled at a bystander to "tell your [..] Mexican friends to get [..] out of Shenandoah or you will be lying next to him." Mr. Ramirez never regained consciousness and died of his head injuries on July 14, 2008. Following the beating, Shenandoah Police Department (SPD) officers obstructed the investigation into Mr. Ramirez's death.  On October 14, 2010, a federal jury found Piekarsky and Donchak guilty of violating the Fair Housing Act, which protects individuals from discrimination in housing on the basis of protected categories such as race. The jury found that the defendants' beating of Mr. Ramirez was motivated by their desire to keep Latinos from living in Shenandoah. Donchak was also convicted of obstructing justice. Both defendants were sentenced to nine years in prison and three years of supervised release. Walsh, who had pleaded guilty in April 2009, testified against the other two assailants. He was sentenced to 55 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Former SPD Chief Nestor and former SPD Lieutenant Moyer were tried in January 2011, and were convicted of falsifying reports and lying to the FBI, respectively. Nestor was sentenced to 13 months in prison and two years of supervised release; Moyer was sentenced to 3 months in prison and one year of supervised release. The jury acquitted a third officer, former SPD Officer Jason Hayes (who was dating Piekarsky's mother at the time of the beating) of obstruction charges.

"Unique approaches to target tumor cells with nanoparticle delivery systems hold promise for treatment of resistant tumors, such as the high risk neuroblastoma. We are hopeful that in the future, nanoparticles can be utilized to personalize care to patients and reduce the late effects of therapy."; Nanoparticles Loaded with Component of Common Spice Kill Cancer Cells: Neuroblastomas are cancers that start in early nerve cells and commonly form in the tissue of the adrenal glands, near the kidneys. About 700 new cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed each year in the United States and most cases appear in children younger than five years old. High-risk neuroblastoma is hard to cure and is more likely to become resistant to standard therapies or recur. These cancers are also associated with late effects after treatments have ended, including developmental delays, hearing loss, or other disabilities.; Nanoparticles Loaded with Component of Common Spice Kill Cancer Cells: Related Article:¬†New Study Suggests That Vitamin D Decreases Risk of Cancer

#Fact check: Cohen sees 'correlation' between North Carolina's mask law, fewer COVID-19 cases: Gov. Roy Cooper announced the mask requirement on June 24 and it went into effect on June 26.Cohen said North Carolina‚Äôs case count started to level about three weeks later. Why is Cohen judging the rule‚Äôs effectiveness three weeks after its implementation, rather than immediately after its implementation?It can take up to 14 days between the time someone was infected and the time they start showing symptoms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That means someone could have contracted the virus before the mask mandate, but not shown symptoms or tested positive until after the mask requirement was in effect.So let‚Äôs look at North Carolina‚Äôs case counts.One way experts measure coronavirus trends is by calculating the 7-day rolling average for the number of new cases or deaths per day. The N.C. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and WRAL both track this metric.The average number of new cases per day rose until about July 18, when DHHS reported 2,481 cases. The daily count started to drop after that date, and the rolling 7-day average has been less than 2,000 cases ever since.New reported COVID-19 cases, deaths in NCNew casesNew deathsNew laboratory confirmed cases and deaths are based on daily reporting from the N.C.

Department of Health and Human Services via the agency's COVID-19 dashboard. The dashboard started publishing case counts on March 13 and death counts on March 26. Because these case and death numbers can lag slightly based on the time it takes labs to process tests and health officials to confirm cases, we're also calculating a seven-day rolling average to show the curve of cases. NOTE: This chart now includes cases and deaths identified through antigen testing, which DHHS began reporting on its dashboard on Sept. 25.

Is that a direct result of the mandate? There‚Äôs evidence that widespread mask-wearing has helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus, as we‚Äôve previously reported.We spoke with experts at the University of North Carolina, Harvard University, the University of Nebraska and the University of Toronto.While they agreed that there may be a correlation, they say there‚Äôs not enough evidence yet to determine how much influence the mask rule had on the stabilization. Other factors -- such as social distancing or testing availability -- could also play a role.But reviewing that data typically takes months, said Ryan McNamara, a research associate in UNC‚Äôs Department of Microbiology and Immunology.‚ÄúThere's just a lot of variables at play that need to be accounted for,‚Äù he said.There‚Äôs a popular saying in research: ‚Äúcorrelation does not mean causation." In this context, it means that the mask law may not have caused the dip in new COVID-19 cases, even though there are signs a cause-and-effect relationship could exist.‚ÄúThat said, Dr. Cohen and her team are in possession of much more data than I am. I think her statement was carefully worded and has scientific merit.‚ÄùAli Khan, dean of the College of Public Health and professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, agreed that it‚Äôs premature to directly credit the mask rule for the leveling-off of cases.But he believes Cohen‚Äôs claim is fair, given that ‚Äúother data that (shows) masks work and accounting for numerous caveats such as what else happened 2-3 weeks ago.‚ÄùDr. Barry Bloom, a research professor of public health at Harvard University, said it‚Äôs ‚Äúdifficult to disaggregate a single intervention from the other standard public health behaviors.‚ÄùHowever, Bloom said it‚Äôs possible that the mask requirement not only prompted more people to wear masks -- but to start taking other precautionary measures as well.‚ÄúI think it is safe to say they may have contributed to the more stable trends, assuming the trends are indeed stable for a couple of weeks,‚Äù Bloom said.As of August 3, the state‚Äôs rolling 7-day average remained below 2,000 cases and was still declining.Our rulingMostly TrueCohen said there‚Äôs a ‚Äúdirect correlation‚Äù between North Carolina‚Äôs mask requirement and COVID-19 stabilization.Based on the data available in late July, experts said there does appear to be a correlation, but it‚Äôs too early to draw conclusions about it. Verifying the strength of the correlation can take months.The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

#Was Winston Churchill Born in a Ladies' Room During a Dance?:  He was born on 30 November 1874 and, mainly by accident, in Blenheim Palace, although in a singularly bleak-looking bedroom.  The accident arose out of his being two months premature. He should have been born in January in the small but fashionable house in Charles Street, Mayfair, which his father had rented to receive him, or more purposefully perhaps to use as a base for the somewhat rackety metropolitan life of which Lord Randolph and his bride of only seven and a half months' standing were equally fond. This house not being ready, they had taken autumn refuge in Blenheim, and, as Lord Randolph put it in a letter to his mother-in-law in Paris, '[Lady Randolph] had a fall on Tuesday walking with the shooters, and a rather imprudent and rough drive in a pony carriage brought on the pains on Saturday night. We tried to stop them, but it was no use.'

She was rushed back to the Palace, where, in the early hours of November 30, he son was born. ; Was Winston Churchill Born in a Ladies' Room During a Dance?: A volume entitled The Private Lives of Winston Churchill sounded promising, and there we found the suggestion that Churchill hadn't been born prematurely at all and that the story about his mother's taking a fall may have been concocted to cover a pre-marital dalliance:; Was Winston Churchill Born in a Ladies' Room During a Dance?: The Private Lives of Winston Churchill.

At the end of the first week the organism is attached to the uterine wall and is being nourished by the mother.

#Myths vs. Facts: Making Sense of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation: Photo by Jackie Ricciardi; Myths vs. Facts: Making Sense of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation: Assoumou: This is the most common question I get asked. I think there is a perception that things moved very fast, but we want to underscore that the technology being used now was being studied for a decade. The main difference between emergency use versus full FDA approval is that you need two months of monitoring rather than six months. When you look at the history of vaccines, if patients were to develop side effects, these occurred within two months. We are now over six months into our experience with these vaccines. We have not seen anything that would make us believe that the risks outweigh the benefits. And vaccines have saved so many lives.; Myths vs. Facts: Making Sense of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation: Hamer: The development was more rapid than many other vaccines. But it used the same process of phase one and phase two trials following appropriate safety measures. Stage three trials were large-scale trials done rigorously with very clear outcome definitions. The safety measures and approaches taken are standard for clinical trials. They just did it more rapidly than usual. The full process review is ongoing and we are already hearing that Pfizer will have full FDA authorization by September and Moderna soon after.; Myths vs. Facts: Making Sense of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation: Assoumou: The reason this is called SARS-COV-2 is that there was a SARS-1, the original one, and scientists were working on this vaccine. So when this pandemic arrived they had already developed a lot of the science. A decade of work was actually going on. That‚Äôs one issue I like to emphasize when people think it was rushed.; Myths vs. Facts: Making Sense of COVID-19 Vaccine Misinformation: The other point I like to remind people is that these vaccines went through all the regulatory steps like any other vaccines. None of this was rushed. The FDA reviewed all the data. When you say ‚ÄúEmergency use,‚Äù people think it was rushed, but the way to think about it is that the benefits outweigh the risks.

#How can we help you?: More Processing news; How can we help you?: On Saturday, a farm in Iksan, 280 km south of Seoul, was confirmed to have been contaminated by the deadly H5N1 virus that can also be fatal to humans. Four days later, a nearby farm was also found to have been exposed to the deadly virus.   According to a government tally, some 140,000 poultry within a 500-meter radius of the breeding farms have so far been destroyed. But an emergency meeting of experts in livestock epidemics and officials from the agriculture ministry on Wednesday shared the opinion that the radius should be expanded, the officials said.   The country's agriculture minister will make a final decision on the issue Thursday, the officials said. A 3-km radius incorporates 40 farms breeding 770,000 livestock, the majority of which are chickens, they said. The government will provide full compensation for the culling.   Between 2003-2004, the government had to spend 45 billion won (US$48.38 million) in culling 5.3 million poultry in the wake of bird flu attacks.

#Tiny Eye Telescope Brings Back A World Of Sight:         Patti Neighmond      ; Tiny Eye Telescope Brings Back A World Of Sight:                  This tiny telescope gets implanted in one eye and magnifies the image to make up for "holes" in the person's vision. It can greatly improve sight for some people with age-related macular degeneration.

It‚Äôs a miniature telescope implanted directly into the eye that magnifies images to more than twice their size. ; Tiny Eye Telescope Brings Back A World Of Sight: Findings from the clinical trials show that the telescope does improve vision for the majority of patients. Still, there are some concerns about corneal damage, since the telescope is relatively large inside the eye. And the population who might benefit from the new device is somewhat limited. The treatment doesn't work for those who have had cataract surgery. And for those who catch the disease early on, there may be better options.; Tiny Eye Telescope Brings Back A World Of Sight: But for 80-year-old Marian Orr, the implanted telescope was just what she needed. Orr has a big family: five children, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.  That means lots of graduations, weddings and school events. In other words, lots to see. So when Orr's vision began to decline in her mid 70s, she got worried. Both her father and uncle went blind in their 60s, and she knew macular degeneration was often inherited.

#The Big Lie That Started Roe v. Wade: Roe v. Wade came in with a whimper, but it resulted in a roar. In 1973, the Supreme Court ruling on the case barely made headlines. It was overshadowed by the death of President Lyndon B. Johnson and by the withdrawal of United States troops from Vietnam. A total of 58,220 American troops died in that war, one for every 1,081 unborn babies who would be killed over the next 50 years.
#Women with Stage 4 breast cancer survive longer if they have surgery, study shows: clockThis article was published more than¬†8 years ago; Women with Stage 4 breast cancer survive longer if they have surgery, study shows: Over the past few decades, as breast cancer has increasingly been treated as a systemic disease, the number of surgeries performed on the most serious cases has plummeted. With better drugs and radiation techniques available, the proportion of women with Stage 4 breast cancer who had surgery dropped from 67.8 percent in 1988 to 25.1 percent in 2011, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Surgery.; Women with Stage 4 breast cancer survive longer if they have surgery, study shows: But the study raises an intriguing question about that approach. It shows that women who had surgery survived longer than those who didn't: a median of 28 months vs. 19 months. When the researchers examined a small subset of the group ‚Äî those who survived 10 years ‚Äî they found that 9.6 percent had chosen to have surgery while 2.9 percent had not.; Women with Stage 4 breast cancer survive longer if they have surgery, study shows: "Maybe we need to revisit this question of surgery," said Mary C.

"It may not be right for all women, but it may be better for some women than it was in 1995."; Women with Stage 4 breast cancer survive longer if they have surgery, study shows: Previous research has reached the same conclusion, but a significant problem with this study and others like it is that they rely on retrospective data, looking back over any number of years, said Michael S. Sabel, the chief of surgical oncology at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the newly published study. In retrospective research, it's impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said.

#Did a TEDx Speaker Say Pedophilia Is an 'Unchangeable Sexual Orientation'?: About this rating   ; Did a TEDx Speaker Say Pedophilia Is an 'Unchangeable Sexual Orientation'?: In her talk, Heine told the story of a 19-year-old Jonas, a Munich law student who is sexually attracted to girls aged six to 12 years old. "But since he's aware of the consequences for the children, he has never given in to his sexual drive." She cited the tenth revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD 10) for the description of pedophilia as the "sexual preference for preadolescent children" and pointed to unspecified research that differentiates between child sexual abusers and pedophiles.; Did a TEDx Speaker Say Pedophilia Is an 'Unchangeable Sexual Orientation'?: Heine's most controversial comments rocketed across the Internet when websites ran reports of them under headlines such as "TEDx Speaker: Pedophilia Is an Unchangeable Orientation," which led some viewers to believe Heine had condoned "an illegal and harmful practice."  Although Heine did make a comment about pedophilia's being an "unchangeable sexual orientation," it was offered in a fuller context which we've transcribed here:; Did a TEDx Speaker Say Pedophilia Is an 'Unchangeable Sexual Orientation'?: Let me very clear here. Abusing children is wrong without any doubt. But a pedophile who doesn't abuse children has done nothing wrong. I want to quickly summarize where we are at the moment. According to current research, pedophilia is an unchangeable sexual orientation, just like for example heterosexuality. No one chooses to be a pedophile. No one can cease being one. The difference between pedophilia and other sexual orientations is that living out this sexual orientation will end in a disaster.; Did a TEDx Speaker Say Pedophilia Is an 'Unchangeable Sexual Orientation'?: Pedophilia is not defined by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) as a sexual orientation: it is classified as a disorder in the fifth and most current revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5). Discussions that attempt to equate pedophilia with sexual orientation have been contentious, primarily because of the false belief that members of the LGBT community are predisposed to child molestation. Those who argue against civil rights for the LGBT community often cast those rights as a slippery slope to legalizing child sexual abuse or bestiality.

#Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives?: About this rating   ; Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives?: "As a researcher focused on mako sharks, I often discuss Megalodon with my colleagues," explained Dovi Kacev, a PhD candidate at San Diego State University studying the population genetics of shortfin mako and common thresher sharks. "We sometimes discuss what it would be like if Megalodon still existed ‚Äî what it would prey upon, where it would live," he said. But as to its current existence?

#Are Black-and-White Caterpillars 'Poisonous'?: About this rating   ; Are Black-and-White Caterpillars 'Poisonous'?: The caterpillar excretes a type of chemical defense upon contact (which is more properly termed 'allergenic' than 'poisonous').  Most people who handle these creatures will experience a burning, nettle-type, itchy rash of mild to moderate severity, but washing the affected area with soap and water, then applying ammonia or calamine lotion and icing the area should set things to rights.  However, some people are hypersensitive to the poison and have allergic reactions to it -- in addition to the itchy rash, those persons are likely to experience more severe symptoms such as swelling and nausea and should seek expert medical advice as soon as possible:; Are Black-and-White Caterpillars 'Poisonous'?:  The hairs on the caterpillar are long and bristle-like and spread out in tufts down the sides. Two long, sharp, black pencil-like hairs protrude near the front and rear of the creature, and these hairs are connected to poison glands, which excrete venom on contact.; Are Black-and-White Caterpillars 'Poisonous'?: Contact with the venom does not generally cause too much of a problem. A nettle or poison ivy-type rash often occurs, which can range from mild with slight reddening of the skin, to burning, swelling and pain, none of which should keep you away from your gardening duties for too long. Hypersensitive individuals may, of course, experience more severe symptoms that could include swelling and nausea. Washing the infected area with soap and water, taking antihistamines, or using ammonia, calamine lotion, or an ice pack can help to alleviate most minor symptoms fairly quickly.

"(Akin's) partly right on that."; Rape and pregnancy statement controversies in the 2012 United States elections: Following Akin's comments, additional controversies arose around other remarks made by various Republican politicians. The most notable of these was by Indiana State Treasurer and US Senate nominee Richard Mourdock, who said that life was "something that God intended", even if the pregnancy was due to rape. Some analysts identified the controversies around Mourdock's and Akin's comments, and those of other candidates, as a principal factor in their election losses.[4][5] The comments may have had an effect on the national election results; many female voters supported Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.[6][7][8] ; Rape and pregnancy statement controversies in the 2012 United States elections: Akin apologized after making the comment, saying he "misspoke", and that he planned to remain in the Senate race.

He said that he meant "legitimate rape" as an abbreviated form of "legitimate case of rape".[46] He also reiterated that he believed a woman's body would prevent conception if she had been raped, due to impact of stress on fertilization. He criticized members of his party for disavowing him, including Karl Rove, former National Republican Senatorial Committee Executive Director Rob Jesmer, Senators Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, John McCain, Roy Blunt, and Lindsey Graham, and House Speaker John Boehner, and what he referred to as the "liberal media" for supposed double standards, comparing his candidacy to that of George Allen, derailed due to Allen's use of a racist slur.[47]

Once we wheeled him inside, he directed us toward the items we‚Äôd need to change him. As Jason wrapped his arms around the veteran, supporting all of his weight, his left leg bled as he lifted him from the wheelchair. As we ‚Äúbathed‚Äù him with baby wipes, and ditched his urine soaked clothing and undergarment, I was certain that a case this urgent would be resolved within days. Eighty days later, I‚Äôm not so na√Øve.; Media: On our 3rd day of visiting the veteran to drop off provisions and a water repellant wool blanket, another couple, wishing to remain anonymous, noticed the three of us and stopped to offer food. Like us, ‚ÄúVictor‚Äù and ‚ÄúSylvia,‚Äù had no idea that this was the inception of what would become the most challenging endeavor of our lives. With sleet beginning to fall, and Victor learning that this man was both paralyzed and prior military, he said, simply, ‚ÄúHelp me put him in my car.‚Äù Stunned, we paused. ‚ÄúI have a partially finished garage with a pull out couch. Let‚Äôs put him in my car, and you guys follow us.‚Äù When asked if he was willing to go with strangers, the veteran was ecstatic to have someplace, any place, to go, the icy precipitation, unrelenting. By day‚Äôs end, we‚Äôd see him safely tucked under warm blankets, surrounded by strangers turned friends. As he cried, he expressed just how good it felt to lay in a bed.; Media: Texas Veterans Commission P.O.

#How immigrants can obtain health coverage:  Are recent immigrants eligible for ACA subsidies?Yes. The ACA called for the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to all adults with income up to 138% of the poverty level, and no exchange subsidies for enrollees with income below the poverty level, since they‚Äôre supposed to receive Medicaid coverage instead. But Medicaid isn‚Äôt available in most states to recent immigrants until they‚Äôve been lawfully present in the U.S. for five years. To get around this problem, Congress included a provision in the ACA to allow recent immigrants to get subsidies in the exchange regardless of how low their income is. Low-income, lawfully present immigrants ‚Äì who would be eligible for Medicaid based on income, but are barred from Medicaid because of their immigration status ‚Äì are eligible to enroll in plans through the exchange with full subsidies during the five years when Medicaid is not available. Their premiums for the second-lowest-cost Silver plan are entirely covered by the premium subsidy through at least the end of 2025. (This is due to the American Rescue Plan and its enhancement of the ACA‚Äôs premium subsidies. These provisions have been extended through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act.) ; How immigrants can obtain health coverage: No, unless a state has established a program for this purpose. Although the ACA provides benefits to U.S. citizens and lawfully present immigrants alike, it does not directly provide any benefits for undocumented immigrants.

Jason Spadaro Thousand Oaks#Chris Kyle and 'American Sniper': Had Kyle gone to New Orleans with a gun? Rumors of snipers ‚Äî both police officers and criminal gunmen ‚Äî circulated in the weeks after the storm. Since then, they have been largely discredited. A spokesman for U.S. Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, told me, "To the best of anyone's knowledge at SOCOM, there were no West Coast SEALs deployed to Katrina." When I related this account to one of Kyle's officers, he replied, sardonically, "I never heard that story." The SEAL with extensive experience in special-mission units wondered how dozens of people could be shot by high-velocity rifles and just disappear; Kyle's version of events, he said, "defies the imagination." ; Chris Kyle and 'American Sniper': Indeed, the account does not hold water simply on the grounds cited in the passage quoted above. Imagining that SEALs were deployed to New Orleans in the chaotic days that followed Katrina is not exceptionally hard, considering the level of disorder that followed the devastation wrought by the hurricane. But the notion that dozens of Americans were shot dead on mere suspicion of (relatively minor) crimes, on American soil and with the full support of a system of law that otherwise does not allow for such summary punitive actions, challenges credulity to a very large degree. Moreover, thirty or so bodies of local residents slain in such a manner never turned up as corroborative evidence of such a claim. The circumstance Kyle claimed would have required the silence and compliance of all witnesses, the families of the dead, all involved law enforcement agencies, and untold others who might have become aware of killings meted out under inarguably public circumstances. Had Kyle and his fellows truly dispatched such a large number of looters or "residents who were contributing to the chaos" (who had neither been charged with nor convicted of any crime, much less a capital one), some other evidence of this tale would have emerged. One person disappearing under such circumstances is unusual; thirty or so is truly unbelievable.; Chris Kyle and 'American Sniper':  [W]riter Michael McAffrey is far less kind.  He excoriates Kyle and reporters who have failed to question Kyle's bogus stories ...; Chris Kyle and 'American Sniper': Kyle also told a story about killing a pair of carjackers in Texas and then dialing up the Pentagon for the law enforcement officials who arrived at the scene.  That's another story that nobody ‚Äî no police, deputy, coroner or witness ‚Äî has been able to confirm.  McAffrey writes, "Just like he didn't shoot two car jackers in the middle of nowhere Texas, and he didn't shoot looters in the aftermath of Katrina. None of those things are true ... but that doesn't mean there aren't people who desperately need them to be true." ; Chris Kyle and 'American Sniper': The site added some telltale markers of a genuine urban legend:
#Issues: global warming: Q: Does consumption of aspartame harm human health?; Experts Debunk Viral Post Claiming 1,100 Scientists Say ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs No Climate Emergency‚Äô: In fact, the term ‚Äúmassive‚Äù in this context could be considered an understatement. A 2013 study found that some 97 percent of peer-reviewed research on climate change was in agreement: rapid climate change is happening beyond what would be considered resulting from natural causes, and humans are largely responsible. And in 2021, another study, this one published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, analyzed 88,125 peer-reviewed studies on climate change and found that a jaw-dropping 99.9 percent of them came to the same conclusion as the 2013 study.; Video wrongly claims past disaster deaths show climate change isn't real | Fact check: "Goofballs on the left are screaming, 'See!

#April 26, 2007: What's up with the Francona-bashing?  * He clearly couched his statement in the world of sports, and set it apart from true heroism in the greater world. The implication that he did not do so is intellectually dishonest. It is obvious that he meant the feat was incredible in the sporting world, not in all of human history. * He said "you hate to use a word like heroic", and then substituted the word "incredible" instead - he didn't say it was one of the "most heroic feats", he said it was one of the "most incredible feats". In essence, he agrees that "heroism" is not the appropriate word to describe Schilling's effort. * Finally, he qualified the statement by saying it was one of the most incredible feats that HE had ever witnessed on the field. Not you, not me, not the nation, not the world, but Terry Francona. He should get out more? To see what, the Ironman Triathalon?  As for this ridiculous paint claim, look at the (gory) picture of Schilling's post-op ankle and apply Occam's Razor. Isn't the simplest possible explanation that the wound bled while he was pitching?; April 26, 2007: This is probably going to end up putting him in the hall of fame though.  Actually, helping the Arizona Diamondbacks AND Boston Red Sox win a World Series is what's going to put him in Cooperstown, which he deserves. People may not like Schilling but you still have to give credit where credit is due. If Craig Biggio can get into the Hall of Fame for hitting doubles (Biggio was a doubles machine), Schilling is a 'shoe' in.; April 26, 2007: BornIcon, by his own admission, Schilling needs a couple more very good to dominant years to merit Hall consideration.  He's at what... 210 wins now? How many Cy Youngs does he have? He also wasn't the most valuable pitcher on either of those championship teams.  (Well, not in the playoffs anyway.); April 26, 2007: For what it's worth, I don't think schilling is hall material yet, which will probably keep him on the mound a couple more years if he can do it.; April 26, 2007: I agree with that assessment. And he seems to as well, which I think is a large part of the reason he wanted an extension.  It's entirely possible that he could toss up another 20+ win season and title this year the way things are going... that'd certainly help his case.

#Abortion Rates Spike 40% In Parts Of Africa When U.S. ‚ÄòGlobal Gag Rule‚Äô Is In Effect: From Donald Trump to Ronald Reagan, recent Republican presidents have all prohibited U.S. financial aid from going to overseas organizations unless they promise not to "perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning." Comparing data in 26 sub-Saharan African nations during those presidencies against the Clinton and Obama administrations -- when the so-called "Mexico City Policy" was not in effect -- researchers founds that the rule led to more abortions and pregnancies as well as lower contraceptive use. Abortion news also comes from Missouri, Kentucky and other states.; Abortion Rates Spike 40% In Parts Of Africa When U.S. ‚ÄòGlobal Gag Rule‚Äô Is In Effect:   						Reuters: 						U.S. 'Gag Rule' Linked To 40% Jump In Abortions In Parts Of Africa					  					A decades-old U.S. government policy reinstated by President Donald Trump in 2017 that restricts international aid to NGOs that support abortion is linked to a 40% rise in abortions in some parts of sub-Saharan African, a study showed on Thursday. The "Mexico City Policy", also known as the "global gag rule", also led to more pregnancies and lower contraceptive use among women in African countries reliant on U.S. foreign aid, the study in the Lancet Global Health journal showed. (Kelland, 6/27)				; Abortion Rates Spike 40% In Parts Of Africa When U.S. ‚ÄòGlobal Gag Rule‚Äô Is In Effect:   						NPR: 						Study: Abortion Rates Go Up When U.S. Cuts Off Aid To Overseas Clinics That 'Promote' Abortion					  					Of course, abortion rates could have changed during those two decades for reasons wholly unrelated to U.S. funding policy. But in an effort to factor out that possibility, the researchers divided the 26 countries into two groups: In the first were countries that received the highest amount per person of U.S. family planning aid. In the second group were the countries that received the lowest amount. The idea is that countries receiving a large amount of aid per person would likely be more vulnerable to changes in the policies governing U.S. aid. So by comparing what happened to the abortion rates in those more aid-dependent countries with the abortion rates of countries that were otherwise similar but less dependent on U.S. money for family planning, the researchers believed they could better isolate the impact of the funding ban on abortion rates.

Supporter of the abortion bans hope they will force the Supreme Court's hand to revisit Roe v. Wade, perhaps undoing it. If the 1973 landmark case protecting a woman's right to an abortion until the fetus is viable were overturned, abortion would not automatically be illegal. Instead, it would allow states to set their own laws legalizing, banning or restricting the procedure at any time during pregnancy.
