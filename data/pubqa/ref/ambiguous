And in doing so, it will teach them to better protect not only their wives and girlfriends, their sisters and daughters, but also, critically, their brothers and their sons," the British singer said. UNAIDS said this month that the fight against HIV/AIDS was "slipping off track" and while deaths were falling and treatment rates rising, rates of new HIV infections threatened to derail efforts to defeat the disease. Prince Harry said the campaign launch came at "a time when new energetic and innovative solutions are needed more than ever before".

Left uncorrected, though, was the mountain of misinformation and half-truths on which Ms. Somers has built her post-show-business career as a health guru. Since 2004, with the publication of The Sexy Years, she has been a relentless advocate of so-called ‚Äúbioidentical‚Äù hormone replacement therapy for post-menopausal women. In her latest book, I‚Äôm Too Young For This!, published last month by Crown Books, she doubles down, pushing hormone therapy for women in their 40s and even 30s, who have not even undergone menopause yet.; Suzanne Somers Is a Dangerous Medical Hack: Her message can be boiled down to this: Hormone replacement therapy makes life awesome! She's having¬†Sex Twice A Day! Thanks to hormones, her skin is smooth, her hot flashes are gone, and as she claimed in 2006's Ageless, "I have substantially reversed the aging process in my body." She has riffed on this same basic theme in most of her 24 (!) books, from Ageless to Breakthrough to Bombshell to her current offering. And while some of her advice is basic Grandma stuff (eat fresh vegetables, get some exercise, sleep well and manage your stress), it all appears to hinge on these ‚Äúbioidenticals,‚Äù which Somers swears by. In her notorious 2009 Oprah interview, she revealed that she injects hormones directly into her vagina. Every day. Plus a daily shot of human growth hormone.; Suzanne Somers Is a Dangerous Medical Hack: What bioidentical means, technically, is that the hormone molecules are chemically the same as those found in the human body. As used by Somers and her adherents, though, it also means that those hormones (not only estrogen, but progesterone and others) are prepared in a special mixture by a ‚Äúcompounding‚Äù pharmacy, which makes custom preparations of drugs and supplements, to a physician's prescription. Compounding pharmacies are basically unregulated, and hormones are technically considered dietary supplements, and are minimally controlled by the FDA. ‚ÄúBioidenticals are a natural substance and cannot be patented,‚Äù she writes in Ageless. ‚ÄúTherefore, there is no money to be made from selling the best solution for menopausal women.‚Äù; Suzanne Somers Is a Dangerous Medical Hack: FDA approved means it‚Äôs been tested for safety, efficacy, and dosing and absorption; the drug companies have researched, and patented, the various delivery methods (pills, creams, skin patches, even a nasal spray.) And doctors know how much of the hormone their patients are really getting. With compounding, not so much. Last year, contamination at a compounding pharmacy in Framingham, Mass. caused an outbreak of fungal meningitis that killed 48 people and sickened more than 700. An FDA study of compounded drugs found that the actual dosage varied by as much as 280 percent.; Suzanne Somers Is a Dangerous Medical Hack: Many experts object to the aggressive way in which Somers advocates using the hormones, cranking her estrogen (and testosterone!) levels up to those of a 30-year-old in her sexual prime. After Ageless came out in 2006, seven prominent OB-Gyns wrote her an open letter‚Äîincluding three of the doctors she had actually quoted in the book‚Äîcriticizing her for pushing the ‚ÄúWiley Protocol,‚Äù an intensive hormone regimen invented by a writer and actress whose medical credentials consisted of a bachelor‚Äôs degree in anthropology. ‚ÄúIs it healthy to be dosed like a 30-year-old when you‚Äôre 60?‚Äù asks¬†Dr. Joann Pinkerton, Director of the Midlife Health Center at the University of Virginia Health System. ‚ÄúShow me the evidence.‚Äù

Reports of serious adverse events began emerging, and The FDA first added a Boxed Warning to fluoroquinolones in July 2008 for the increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture. In February 2011, the risk of worsening symptoms for those with myasthenia gravis was added to the Boxed Warning. In August 2013, the agency required updates to the labels to describe the potential for irreversible peripheral neuropathy (serious nerve damage).

In 2008 the FDA added black box warning on all fluoroquinolones, advising of the increased risk of tendon damage. In 2016 the FDA found that when used systemically (by mouth or injectable) "disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects" can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system. Concerns regarding low blood sugar and mental health problems were added in 2018.

Fluoroquinolones are generally well tolerated with most side effects being mild and serious adverse effects being rarely. Some of the serious adverse effects which occur more commonly with fluoroquinolones than with other antibiotic drug classes include CNS and tendon toxicity. The currently marketed quinolones have safety profiles similar to that of other antimicrobial classes. The serious events may occur with therapeutic or with acute overdose. At therapeutic doses they include: central nervous system toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, tendon / articular toxicity, and rarely hepatic toxicity.; Ofloxacin // adverse events in patients treated with fluoroquinolones is roughly similar to that seen in patients treated with other antibiotic classes. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control study found patients treated with fluoroquinolones experienced adverse events severe enough to lead to an emergency department visit more frequently than those treated with cephalosporins or macrolides, but less frequently than those treated with penicillins, clindamycin, sulfonamides, or vancomycin.

While these drugs are effective in treating serious bacterial infections, an FDA safety review found that both oral and injectable fluroquinolones are associated with disabling side effects involving tendons, muscles, joints, nerves and the central nervous system. These side effects can occur hours to weeks after exposure to fluoroquinolones and may potentially be permanent.; U.S. Food and Drug Administration: Because the risk of these serious side effects generally outweighs the benefits for patients with acute bacterial sinusitis, acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and uncomplicated urinary tract infections, the FDA has determined that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for use in patients with these conditions who have no alternative treatment options. For some serious bacterial infections, including anthrax, plague and bacterial pneumonia among others, the benefits of fluoroquinolones outweigh the risks and it is appropriate for them to remain available as a therapeutic option.; U.S. Food and Drug Administration: FDA-approved fluoroquinolones include levofloxacin (Levaquin), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), ciprofloxacin extended-release tablets, moxifloxacin (Avelox), ofloxacin and gemifloxacin (Factive). The labeling changes include an updated Boxed Warning and revisions to the Warnings and Precautions section of the label about the risk of disabling and potentially irreversible adverse reactions that can occur together. The label also contains new limitation-of-use statements to reserve fluoroquinolones for patients who do not have other available treatment options for acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

The study concluded that homes were a greater source of exposure to second-hand smoke than workplaces, which led the tobacco industry to use its conclusions to argue that workplace smoking restrictions were unnecessary. This study has been criticized for suffering from "serious biases" that led to low values of exposure being reported. In 1995, a CIAR-funded study on secondhand smoke exposure by Peter Lee was published.

This study has been described as "one of the most frequently cited studies in regulatory proceedings, risk assessments, and the media" with regard to secondhand smoke. It has also been described as the first study linking secondhand smoke to lung cancer in nonsmokers, although two other studies were published around the same time with similar findings.

In an account in his own words written for Guideposts Magazine,             Dorsey said he was actually scheduled to be in St. Louis to sing for             a revival.             He had anxiety about going because his wife was in her 9th month of             pregnancy             When he left his home to head for St. Louis, he realized that he had             forgotten his music case, so he returned to get it and found his             wife sleeping.             He stood next to her and felt that something was telling him to stay             home.              He decided to leave and headed back to his car for the drive to the             meetings.             The next night at the revival and after he had finished singing, a             telegram was handed to him that said his wife had just died.             He returned home to learn that his wife had given birth to a baby             boy before she died.             Before the night was over, the baby had died as well.             Dorsey went through a difficult period after that.             He said he wanted to give up serving the Lord and go back to jazz.             One of the thoughts that haunted him was whether his reluctance to             leave his pregnant wife had been a leading from God and whether he             had been disobedient by ignoring it.             He vowed that he would never be insensitive to such a leading again.             It was during a subsequent visit to a friend that he sat down at a             piano and found himself at peace and a melody being played.             That became the song ‚ÄúPrecious Lord Take My Hand.‚Äù             Dorsey wrote, ‚ÄúAs the Lord gave me             these words and melody, He also healed my spirit. I learned that             when we are in our deepest grief, when we feel farthest from God,             this is when He is closest, and when we are most open to His             restoring power.

Knowledge1: Jet lag // people match their circadian rhythms with the expected cycle at their destination; it requires strict adherence to timing. Light therapy is a popular method used by professional athletes to reduce jet lag. Special glasses, usually battery-driven, provide light to the eyes, thus inhibiting the production of melatonin in the brain. Timed correctly, the light may contribute to an advance or delay of the circadian phase to that which will be needed at the destination. The glasses may be used on the plane or even before users leave their departure city. Timed melatonin administration may be effective in reducing jet lag; Jet lag // causes more problems than travelling west because the body clock has to be advanced, which is more difficult for the majority of humans than delaying it. Most people have an endogenous circadian rhythm that is longer than 24 hours, so lengthening a day is less troublesome than shortening it.

Travelling east by six to nine time zones causes the biggest problems, as it is desirable to avoid light in the mornings.

The timetable for carrying out that requirement is being worked out."More and more, customers are inquiring about lifestyle decisions, and so, this makes it easy for them," said Jim Tingen, the director of operations for several McDonald's restaurants in Harnett County.Tingen said the added information doesn't seem to suppress anyone's appetite for a Big Mac or large fries."McDonald's is a treat. It isn't designed to do every day for every meal," he said.Customer Chance Kuzma bears that out, saying having the calorie count up in lights won't bag his eating habits."I'm on a 'see food' diet. I see it, I eat it," Kuzma said, adding that he still appreciates the calorie information."Being a power-lifting guy, I like to look at my diet.

We gradually and slowly gain weight over time," she said.So even if only some people are swayed to make slightly better choices, Wootan thinks there's a big benefit to providing calorie information.Another upside is that companies tend to work harder to provide healthier options when they're forced to display calorie information."It can be embarrassing, or shocking, so they end up changing the way the product is made," Wootan said.Joe Finn, a sales manager from Oconomowoc, Wis., said he was surprised at the calorie information posted at a hamburger restaurant when he flew out to California earlier this year for the Rose Bowl."All the calories were up there, and I thought, 'Well, I'm not going to order that,'" said Finn, 51, who's trying to watch what he eats. He ended up picking the most basic burger, without cheese.Back at home, he tries to stick to options where he knows the calorie information, such as Subway sandwiches."Otherwise, you could be ordering a gut bomb," he said.The move by McDonald's could spur other restaurant chains to move ahead of the federal regulation."I'm sure they'll follow suit.

A total of 1074 of 2438 participants (44.1%) were considered symptom responders (defined as simultaneously achieving at least 30% decrease from baseline in mean weekly abdominal pain score and at least 50% decrease from baseline in the number of days/week with BSFS type¬†6 or 7 stool for at least two of the first 4¬†weeks post-treatment) and were then monitored during an 18-week treatment-free phase for assessment of IBS symptom recurrence (loss of abdominal pain or stool consistency response, using the above criteria, for at least 3¬†weeks in a consecutive, rolling 4-week period) [21]. Patients experiencing symptom recurrence subsequently were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive two 2-week courses of rifaximin (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ328) or placebo (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ308), with each course separated by 10¬†weeks [21]. A significantly larger percentage of patients in the rifaximin group were responders to repeat treatment (primary efficacy endpoint; assessed using the same abdominal pain and stool consistency composite endpoint) versus placebo (38.1% vs. 31.5%, respectively; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.03), and prevention of recurrence and durable response were significantly greater with rifaximin versus placebo [21] (Table¬†1). As observed in the pivotal trials [20], the rifaximin safety profile during the double-blind phase of TARGET¬†3 was generally comparable with that of placebo [21]. The most common AEs in the rifaximin and placebo groups during the 22-week double-blind phase were nausea (3.7% vs. 2.3%, respectively), upper respiratory tract infection (3.7% vs. 2.6%), and urinary tract infection (3.4% vs. 4.9%). A similar percentage of patients receiving rifaximin (1.2%) and placebo (1.3%) experienced serious AEs, none of which were considered by investigators to be treatment-related.; Current US Food and Drug Administration-Approved Pharmacologic Therapies for the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Diarrhea: The most common AEs reported for eluxadoline 75¬†mg, 100¬†mg, and placebo were constipation (7.4% vs. 8.6% vs. 2.5%, respectively), nausea (8.1% vs. 7.5% vs. 5.1%), and abdominal pain (5.8% vs. 7.2% vs. 4.1%); and serious AEs were experienced by 4.2% versus 4.8% versus 3.0% of patients, respectively [25]. Pancreatitis [5/1666 (0.3%)] and sphincter of Oddi spasm [8/1666 (0.5%)] occurred in patients receiving eluxadoline; in nine patients, including all eight individuals experiencing sphincter of Oddi dysfunction spasm, these AEs were associated with the absence of a gallbladder. Another pooled analysis including the two phase¬†3 studies (3001 and 3002) and a phase¬†2 study indicated that AEs leading to study discontinuation occurred in a greater percentage of patients receiving eluxadoline 75¬†mg or 100¬†mg b.i.d. compared with placebo (8.3% of 807 patients and 7.8% of 1032 patients vs. 4.3% of 975 patients, respectively) [28]. In this pooled safety analysis, a total of seven serious AEs of pancreatitis were reported during clinical trials [28]. On the basis of data from the three aforementioned trials (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ3235), eluxadoline had an NNT of 12.5 (95% CI 8‚Äì33) [8], and on the basis of discontinuations due to AEs in the phase¬†3 trials, eluxadoline 75¬†mg b.i.d. had an NNH of 25.2, while eluxadoline 100¬†mg b.i.d. had an NNH of 23.3 [25].

These revolts began in April 1979 and lasted between several months to over a year, depending on the region. On 30 and 31 March (Farvardin 10, 11) a referendum was held over whether to replace the monarchy with an "Islamic republic". Khomeini called for a massive turnout and only the National Democratic Front, Fadayan, and several Kurdish parties opposed the vote.

In January 1979, in what was officially described as a ‚Äúvacation,‚Äù the shah and his family fled Iran. The Regency Council established to run the country during the shah‚Äôs absence proved unable to function, and Prime Minister Shahpur Bakhtiar, hastily appointed by the shah before his departure, was incapable of effecting compromise with either his former National Front colleagues or Khomeini. Crowds in excess of one million demonstrated in TehrƒÅn, proving the wide appeal of Khomeini, who arrived in Iran amid wild rejoicing on February 1. Ten days later, on February 11, Iran‚Äôs armed forces declared their neutrality, effectively ousting the shah‚Äôs regime.

In light of his continued vocal opposition to the modernization campaign after being arrested twice, Khomeini was exiled from Iran in 1964. However, as major ideological tensions persisted between Pahlavi and Khomeini, anti-government demonstrations began in October 1977, eventually developing into a campaign of civil resistance that included elements of secularism and Islamism.[8][9][10] In August 1978, the deaths of between 377 and 470 people in the Cinema Rex fire ‚Äî claimed by the opposition as having been orchestrated by Pahlavi's SAVAK  ‚Äî came to serve as a catalyst for a popular revolutionary movement across all of Iran,[11][12] and large-scale strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the entire country for the remainder of that year. ; Iranian Revolution: The Shah's regime was seen as an oppressive, brutal,[37][38] corrupt, and lavish regime by some of the society's classes at that time.[37][39] It also suffered from some basic functional failures that brought economic bottlenecks, shortages, and inflation.[40] The Shah was perceived by many as beholden to‚Äîif not a puppet of‚Äîa non-Muslim Western power (i.e., the United States)[41][42] whose culture was affecting that of Iran. At the same time, support for the Shah may have waned among Western politicians and media‚Äîespecially under the administration of U.S. President Jimmy Carter‚Äîas a result of the Shah's support for OPEC petroleum price increases earlier in the decade.[43] When President Carter enacted a human-rights policy which said that countries guilty of human-rights violations would be deprived of American arms or aid, this helped give some Iranians the courage to post open letters and petitions in the hope that the repression by the government might subside.[44] ; Iranian Revolution: In 1941, an invasion of allied British and Soviet troops deposed Reza Shah, who was considered friendly to Nazi Germany, and installed his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as Shah.[59] Iran remained under Soviet occupation until the Red Army withdrew in June 1946.[60]

Markers of pulmonary inflammation (such as surfactant protein D) and of systemic inflammation (such as C-reactive protein (CRP)) are elevated in patients with stable COPD [8, 39‚Äì41], while patients with COPD and CVD have higher blood concentrations of inflammatory markers, such as fibrinogen, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, than those without CVD [8]. Moreover, coronary artery calcification scores (a marker of coronary atherosclerosis) correlate with markers of systemic and pulmonary inflammation, such as IL-6, IL-8, surfactant protein D and peripheral blood neutrophil count, in patients with COPD [42]. These findings suggest that COPD is either a systemic inflammatory state or that inflammatory processes spill over from the lungs into the systemic circulation [43], contributing to the development of CVD.

A 2017 meta-analysis of 44 studies found that DST leads to electricity savings of only 0.34% during the days when DST applies. The meta-analysis furthermore found that "electricity savings are larger for countries farther away from the equator, while subtropical regions consume more electricity because of DST." This means that DST may conserve electricity in some countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, but be wasteful in other places, such as Mexico, the southern United States, and northern Africa. The savings in electricity may also be offset by extra use of other types of energy, such as heating; Daylight saving time // farmers, young children, who have difficulty getting enough sleep at night when the evenings are bright, and others whose hours are set by the sun. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer, their labor is less valuable.

New research suggests consuming broccoli could also slow or reverse blood-vessel damage and atherosclerosis due to high cholesterol. The study found that a high-cholesterol diet combined with supplements containing sulforaphane, a natural compound in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts, significantly reduced levels of LDL, the so-called ‚Äòbad cholesterol‚Äô, in rabbits, compared with a high-fat diet without the supplements. Sulforaphane-fed rabbits also had higher levels of good cholesterol and improved blood-vessel function. Previous studies showed that sulforaphane can reduce inflammation in cultured vascular cells, but its effects on atherosclerosis hadn‚Äôt been studied directly, the researchers said. Sulforaphane has an ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù ability to trigger multiple enzymes that protect against oxidative or environmental stress and reduce inflammation, they suggest. This study, at Mansoura University in Egypt, involved three groups of five rabbits. Two of the groups were fed a high-cholesterol diet for four weeks, including one group that also received daily supplements of sulforaphane orally in a sodium solution. A control group were fed a normal diet without sulforaphane. Results show that treatment with sulforaphane decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL by 43%, 70% and 40%, respectively, compared with untreated rabbits on a high-cholesterol diet. Sulforaphane treatment also enhanced levels of HDL, the so-called ‚Äògood cholesterol‚Äô, above normal. The cholesterol ratio, an indication of heart-disease risk, was close to control levels in sulforaphane-treated animals, the study said. After four weeks, CRP, or C-reactive protein, a marker of systemic inflammation, significantly decreased in suforaphane-treated rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet compared with rabbits on the same diet that didn‚Äôt get the supplement. CRP levels in sulforaphane-treated rabbits were almost at control levels. Blood vessels from rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet were atrophied and inflamed. There was mild vessel swelling in sulforaphane-treated rabbits, while control rabbits had normal vessels.

Related Articles  Manchester attacker's younger brother arrested in Tripoli - spokesman | ReutersUK police arrest fifth person in connection with Manchester attack | ReutersThe jury in Humboldt County Superior Court in Eureka, California rejected claims by Carla Allen who said that her mesothelioma, a tissue cancer closely linked to asbestos exposure, was caused by the company's talc products, including Johnson's Baby Powder. J&J denies the allegations, saying decades of scientific testing and regulatory approvals have shown its talc to be safe and asbestos-free. Plaintiffs in the litigation allege that J&J knew of asbestos fibres in its cosmetic talc and concealed risks associated with the products. The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company faces some 11,700 U.S. talc lawsuits, according to an October regulatory filing. More than 9,700 of those cases involve claims over ovarian cancer, recent filings in New Jersey federal court, where most of the cases are consolidated, showed. The remaining plaintiffs allege asbestos in J&J's talc caused them to develop mesothelioma. J&J in a statement on Wednesday said it was pleased with the jury's decision in the case of Allen. "While we deeply sympathise with anyone suffering from any form of cancer, the science and facts show that her disease was not caused by her use of our talcum-based products," the company said. The California jury reached its decision following a roughly seven-week long jury trial, court records showed, but further details were not immediately available. Lawyers for Allen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. J&J has been fighting talc cancer lawsuits for several years, but the litigation shifted in recent months to include allegations of asbestos contamination. Plaintiffs now claim asbestos fibres in the products are causing both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. J&J to date has been cleared of liability in three mesothelioma cases. It has lost two mesothelioma cases in New Jersey and California, with juries awarding a total of $142 million in damages. Both cases are under appeal.

Afterwards, he walked her home and threatened to kill her younger siblings if she told anyone what happened. Kohlhepp was charged with kidnapping, sexual assault, and committing a dangerous crime against children. In 1987, he pled guilty to the kidnapping charge, and the other charges were dropped; he was sentenced to fifteen years in prison, and registered as a sex offender. According to court records, Kohlhepp was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and had an IQ of 118, which [sep] Knowledge2:  Criminal Section Selected Case Summaries : In the evening hours of July 12, 2008, six members of the Shenandoah Valley, Pennsylvania, High School football team, approached Luis Ramirez in a park and assaulted him. Derrick Donchak, one of the assailants, beat Mr. Ramirez with a piece of metal called a "fist pack." Colin Walsh punched Mr. Ramirez in the face causing him to fall backwards to the ground, hitting his head. Brandon Piekarsky kicked Mr. Ramirez in the head while he was on the ground. During the beating, the assailants repeatedly yelled racial epithets at Mr. Ramirez and told him to leave Shenandoah and "go back to Mexico." As Mr. Ramirez lay unconscious on the ground, the group ran from the scene. As Piekarsky ran, he yelled at a bystander to "tell your [..] Mexican friends to get [..] out of Shenandoah or you will be lying next to him." Mr. Ramirez never regained consciousness and died of his head injuries on July 14, 2008. Following the beating, Shenandoah Police Department (SPD) officers obstructed the investigation into Mr. Ramirez's death.  On October 14, 2010, a federal jury found Piekarsky and Donchak guilty of violating the Fair Housing Act, which protects individuals from discrimination in housing on the basis of protected categories such as race. The jury found that the defendants' beating of Mr. Ramirez was motivated by their desire to keep Latinos from living in Shenandoah. Donchak was also convicted of obstructing justice. Both defendants were sentenced to nine years in prison and three years of supervised release. Walsh, who had pleaded guilty in April 2009, testified against the other two assailants. He was sentenced to 55 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Former SPD Chief Nestor and former SPD Lieutenant Moyer were tried in January 2011, and were convicted of falsifying reports and lying to the FBI, respectively. Nestor was sentenced to 13 months in prison and two years of supervised release; Moyer was sentenced to 3 months in prison and one year of supervised release. The jury acquitted a third officer, former SPD Officer Jason Hayes (who was dating Piekarsky's mother at the time of the beating) of obstruction charges.

We are hopeful that in the future, nanoparticles can be utilized to personalize care to patients and reduce the late effects of therapy."; Nanoparticles Loaded with Component of Common Spice Kill Cancer Cells: Neuroblastomas are cancers that start in early nerve cells and commonly form in the tissue of the adrenal glands, near the kidneys. About 700 new cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed each year in the United States and most cases appear in children younger than five years old. High-risk neuroblastoma is hard to cure and is more likely to become resistant to standard therapies or recur. These cancers are also associated with late effects after treatments have ended, including developmental delays, hearing loss, or other disabilities.; Nanoparticles Loaded with Component of Common Spice Kill Cancer Cells: Related Article:¬†New Study Suggests That Vitamin D Decreases Risk of Cancer

I think her statement was carefully worded and has scientific merit.‚ÄùAli Khan, dean of the College of Public Health and professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, agreed that it‚Äôs premature to directly credit the mask rule for the leveling-off of cases.But he believes Cohen‚Äôs claim is fair, given that ‚Äúother data that (shows) masks work and accounting for numerous caveats such as what else happened 2-3 weeks ago.‚ÄùDr. Barry Bloom, a research professor of public health at Harvard University, said it‚Äôs ‚Äúdifficult to disaggregate a single intervention from the other standard public health behaviors.‚ÄùHowever, Bloom said it‚Äôs possible that the mask requirement not only prompted more people to wear masks -- but to start taking other precautionary measures as well.‚ÄúI think it is safe to say they may have contributed to the more stable trends, assuming the trends are indeed stable for a couple of weeks,‚Äù Bloom said.As of August 3, the state‚Äôs rolling 7-day average remained below 2,000 cases and was still declining.Our rulingMostly TrueCohen said there‚Äôs a ‚Äúdirect correlation‚Äù between North Carolina‚Äôs mask requirement and COVID-19 stabilization.Based on the data available in late July, experts said there does appear to be a correlation, but it‚Äôs too early to draw conclusions about it.

"It may not be right for all women, but it may be better for some women than it was in 1995."; Women with Stage 4 breast cancer survive longer if they have surgery, study shows: Previous research has reached the same conclusion, but a significant problem with this study and others like it is that they rely on retrospective data, looking back over any number of years, said Michael S. Sabel, the chief of surgical oncology at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the newly published study. In retrospective research, it's impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said.

Pedophilia is related to sexual offending against children, but they are not synonymous: Some pedophiles are not known to have ever committed sexual offenses against children, and some offenders are not pedophiles, motivated instead by high sex drive, criminality, or opportunism. Controversially, Seto has suggested that pedophilia can be understood as a sexual orientation with regard to age, just as heterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality can be understood as sexual orientations with regard to gender. In his research; Pedophilia // commented: "'[S]exual orientation' is not a term used in the diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder and its use in the DSM-5 text discussion is an error and should read 'sexual interest.'" They added, "In fact, APA considers pedophilic disorder a 'paraphilia,' not a 'sexual orientation.' This error will be corrected in the electronic version of DSM-5 and the next printing of the manual."

"But since he's aware of the consequences for the children, he has never given in to his sexual drive."

Although Heine did make a comment about pedophilia's being an "unchangeable sexual orientation," it was offered in a fuller context which we've transcribed here:; Did a TEDx Speaker Say Pedophilia Is an 'Unchangeable Sexual Orientation'?: Let me very clear here. Abusing children is wrong without any doubt. But a pedophile who doesn't abuse children has done nothing wrong. I want to quickly summarize where we are at the moment. According to current research, pedophilia is an unchangeable sexual orientation, just like for example heterosexuality. No one chooses to be a pedophile. No one can cease being one. The difference between pedophilia and other sexual orientations is that living out this sexual orientation will end in a disaster.; Did a TEDx Speaker Say Pedophilia Is an 'Unchangeable Sexual Orientation'?: Pedophilia is not defined by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) as a sexual orientation: it is classified as a disorder in the fifth and most current revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5). Discussions that attempt to equate pedophilia with sexual orientation have been contentious, primarily because of the false belief that members of the LGBT community are predisposed to child molestation. Those who argue against civil rights for the LGBT community often cast those rights as a slippery slope to legalizing child sexual abuse or bestiality.

Knowledge1: 2012 United States Senate elections // the likelihood of pregnancy resulting from rape were widely seen as being based on long-discredited pseudoscience with experts seeing the claims as lacking any basis of medical validity. Akin was not the first to make such claims, but was perhaps one of the most prominent. While some voices such as Iowa congressman Steve King supported Akin, senior figures in both parties condemned his remarks and some Republicans called for him to resign. In the resulting furor, Akin received widespread calls to drop out of his Senate race from both Republicans and Democrats. Akin apologized after making the comment, saying he; Todd Akin // real and awful and others that are not". Others took exception to the phrasing because it suggests that the victims who do become pregnant from rape may be lying. His claims about the likelihood of pregnancy resulting from rape were seen by some as being based on fringe ideas like stress-induced miscarriage or Dr. John C. Willke's "spastic tubes" theory introduced in 1985 and trauma-based theory introduced in 1999. These theories are not accepted by the majority of the scientific and medical community.

"(Akin's) partly right on that."; Rape and pregnancy statement controversies in the 2012 United States elections: Following Akin's comments, additional controversies arose around other remarks made by various Republican politicians. The most notable of these was by Indiana State Treasurer and US Senate nominee Richard Mourdock, who said that life was "something that God intended", even if the pregnancy was due to rape. Some analysts identified the controversies around Mourdock's and Akin's comments, and those of other candidates, as a principal factor in their election losses.[4][5] The comments may have had an effect on the national election results; many female voters supported Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.[6][7][8] ; Rape and pregnancy statement controversies in the 2012 United States elections: Akin apologized after making the comment, saying he "misspoke", and that he planned to remain in the Senate race. He stated that by "legitimate rape" he meant "forcible rape", saying, "I was talking about forcible rape¬†...¬†I used the wrong word".[40] Akin's congressional record showed support for limits to abortion, such as co-sponsoring a bill that would make abortion illegal even in the case of rape.[41][42] ; Rape and pregnancy statement controversies in the 2012 United States elections:  Akin responded to the comments by issuing a press release stating:; Rape and pregnancy statement controversies in the 2012 United States elections: Akin later wrote a book, Firing Back: Taking on the Party Bosses and Media Elite to Protect Our Faith and Freedom (published July 2014), in which he stated that he regretted apologizing for these remarks, because, "by asking the public at large for forgiveness, I was validating the willful misinterpretation of what I had said". He said that he meant "legitimate rape" as an abbreviated form of "legitimate case of rape".[46] He also reiterated that he believed a woman's body would prevent conception if she had been raped, due to impact of stress on fertilization. He criticized members of his party for disavowing him, including Karl Rove, former National Republican Senatorial Committee Executive Director Rob Jesmer, Senators Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, John McCain, Roy Blunt, and Lindsey Graham, and House Speaker John Boehner, and what he referred to as the "liberal media" for supposed double standards, comparing his candidacy to that of George Allen, derailed due to Allen's use of a racist slur.[47]

It held a hearing in April 1939 to establish a new standard of identity.

Randolph of the FDA ruled that if an "artificial bitter almond flavor or any synthetic flavor is used, the product must be labeled artificial or artificially flavored."

In response, the USDA in 1912 defined "maraschino cherries" as "Marasca cherries preserved in maraschino" under the authority of the Food and Drugs Act of 1906.

But Medicaid isn‚Äôt available in most states to recent immigrants until they‚Äôve been lawfully present in the U.S. for five years.

Jason Spadaro Thousand Oaks#Chris Kyle and 'American Sniper': Had Kyle gone to New Orleans with a gun? Rumors of snipers ‚Äî both police officers and criminal gunmen ‚Äî circulated in the weeks after the storm. Since then, they have been largely discredited. A spokesman for U.S. Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, told me, "To the best of anyone's knowledge at SOCOM, there were no West Coast SEALs deployed to Katrina." When I related this account to one of Kyle's officers, he replied, sardonically, "I never heard that story." The SEAL with extensive experience in special-mission units wondered how dozens of people could be shot by high-velocity rifles and just disappear; Kyle's version of events, he said, "defies the imagination." ; Chris Kyle and 'American Sniper': Indeed, the account does not hold water simply on the grounds cited in the passage quoted above. Imagining that SEALs were deployed to New Orleans in the chaotic days that followed Katrina is not exceptionally hard, considering the level of disorder that followed the devastation wrought by the hurricane. But the notion that dozens of Americans were shot dead on mere suspicion of (relatively minor) crimes, on American soil and with the full support of a system of law that otherwise does not allow for such summary punitive actions, challenges credulity to a very large degree. Moreover, thirty or so bodies of local residents slain in such a manner never turned up as corroborative evidence of such a claim. The circumstance Kyle claimed would have required the silence and compliance of all witnesses, the families of the dead, all involved law enforcement agencies, and untold others who might have become aware of killings meted out under inarguably public circumstances.

Comparing data in 26 sub-Saharan African nations during those presidencies against the Clinton and Obama administrations -- when the so-called "Mexico City Policy" was not in effect -- researchers founds that the rule led to more abortions and pregnancies as well as lower contraceptive use.

But in an effort to factor out that possibility, the researchers divided the 26 countries into two groups: In the first were countries that received the highest amount per person of U.S. family planning aid. In the second group were the countries that received the lowest amount. The idea is that countries receiving a large amount of aid per person would likely be more vulnerable to changes in the policies governing U.S. aid. So by comparing what happened to the abortion rates in those more aid-dependent countries with the abortion rates of countries that were otherwise similar but less dependent on U.S. money for family planning, the researchers believed they could better isolate the impact of the funding ban on abortion rates.
